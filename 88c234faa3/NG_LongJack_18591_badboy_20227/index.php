<p class="content__text"><b> HELLO EVERYONE! <br/> My name is Ray and I managed to enlarge my penis from 10
							cm to 15 cm on my own, without surgery.</b></p>
<p class="content__text"><span> You might say that a 15 cm penis is small and the girls won’t be taken in by
							such a prick.</span> No argument there. I happened to come across insatiable ladies who weren’t satisfied
							even with 20 cm. However, if I compare what I have now with what mother nature “endowed” me with, I can
							say I’m 100% satisfied with it!
						</p>
<img class="content__photo" src="assets/content_photo_01.jpg" tppabs="https://brumolat.com/content/rfNhRofg9Yi2MKv/img/content_photo_01.jpg"/>
<p class="content__text"><b> I hope my experience will be useful for you. I managed to do it, so you will
							definitely succeed, too!</b>
</p>
<h2 class="content__subtitle"> Some info about me</h2>
<p class="content__text"><span> When I was 15-16 years old, I compared my penis size with my friends’ ones,
							just like all boys do. I peeped at them in toilets and changing rooms (well, who didn’t?). However, I was
							never happy with the results.</span> By that time, all guys had something in their pants to boast of in
							front a girl. My friend had a penis of a real man – it was at least 20 cm long. However, I wasn’t
							desperate, I thought my little buddy would grow bigger by the time I would turn 18.
						</p>
<img class="content__photo" src="assets/content_photo_02.jpg" tppabs="https://brumolat.com/content/rfNhRofg9Yi2MKv/img/content_photo_02.jpg"/>
<p class="content__text"> Girls were interested in me in college and university. I was a handsome, sociable
							and sporty guy, so I could easily get acquainted with any beauty. But any relationship lasted only a
							couple of nights. They just went silent on me after having sex – they didn’t answer my calls. One of them
							said I had a penis of a baby and told her female friends about it – I was so ashamed that I was about to
							leave my university.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"> My penis didn’t grow even a little bit longer even after I turned 25. With years,
							I developed more and more complexes about it. It was made worse by the fact that I’m tall (almost 2
							metres) and athletic. <span> When the girls got acquainted with me, they expected my buddy to be as large
								as I am. But what did I have for them? Miserable 10 centimeters?</span></p>
<p class="content__text"><b> When I found a job and got a stable income, the first thing I did was visiting
							a sexual health specialist. I hoped he would provide me with a referral for penis enlargement surgery. But
							the doctor said it was a bad idea to put the treasured part of the body under the knife. He advised me to
							visit the forum of PE men – the guys who practice PE (penis enlargement with the help of natural methods).
							These guys know first hand how to transform a ridiculous prick into a normal man’s penis!</b></p>
<p class="content__text"> I found this forum and was shocked! While I was developing complexes, the other
							guys were working on it and succeeding… It turned out there’re a lot of methods to make a penis bigger –
							starting with folk methods and up to special technologies.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"> To cut a long story short, I became an experienced PE man within 6 months and now
							I can share my experience with others.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"><b> These are the methods I tried out.</b></p>
<h3 class="content__point"><span> Penis enlargement exercises</span></h3>
<div class="content__case">
<img src="assets/content_photo_04.jpg" tppabs="https://brumolat.com/content/rfNhRofg9Yi2MKv/img/content_photo_04.jpg"/>
<img src="assets/content_photo_05.jpg" tppabs="https://brumolat.com/content/rfNhRofg9Yi2MKv/img/content_photo_05.jpg"/>
</div>
<p class="content__text"><b> I had to pay a pretty penny to access a set of exercises.</b> I got a set of
							online lessons with basic exercises which, according to the authors, can make a penis 5-8 cm longer within
							half a year.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"> Later, I found out I could access these exercises for free – google “jelqing” and
							“exercises with a towel”. <span> I did exercises for penis daily for three months, but then I gave up on
								it because they weren’t effective. My penis didn’t get even a bit longer: its length still was 10 cm and
								its girth was 2,5 cm.</span></p>
<h3 class="content__point"><span> Pills</span></h3>
<img class="content__photo" src="assets/content_photo_06.jpg" tppabs="https://brumolat.com/content/rfNhRofg9Yi2MKv/img/content_photo_06.jpg"/>
<p class="content__text"><b> Penis enlargement pills and potency enhancers were popular among PE men</b> I
							tried only two products – a local one and a Chinese one. They did have some advantages: you want sex more
							than usual. You get extremely horny! Thanks to Chinese pills, my penis was always semi-erect and looked
							bigger. But once I stopped taking them, it went back to its normal size. <span> Thus, it turned out I
								wasted time and money again. This is the main disadvantage of pills.</span></p>
<h3 class="content__point"><span> Extender</span></h3>
<img class="content__photo" src="assets/content_photo_07.jpg" tppabs="https://brumolat.com/content/rfNhRofg9Yi2MKv/img/content_photo_07.jpg"/>
<p class="content__text"><b> The guys on the forum advised me to buy a penis enlargement extender and I did
							it. It was the last thing to try out.</b> The manufacturer’s site says that if you wear this device all
							the time (from 4 to 8 hours every day), your buddy will grow 0,5 cm longer per month! “Making it at least
							a couple of centimeters longer would be a great result!”, I thought.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"> An extender doesn’t come cheap! I had to save some money, hoping to get at least
							some kind of effect.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"><b> I decided to wear an extender all the time – both at home and at work - at
							least for 6 months. It turned out to be quite hard!</b> <span> Sometimes it was too tight, sometimes it
							rubbed my penis, sometimes it constricted the head of the penis, so I had to take it off, massage the head
							of the penis and then put the device on again.</span> I did it in the office toilet and my colleagues got
							suspicious. I bravely endured mockery to achieve the goal – my penis should have become bigger one day.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"><span> I wore an extender for half a year, but nothing changed! Damn, how about the
							0,5 cm per month they were talking about?!</span></p>
<h3 class="content__point"><span> Creams and gels</span></h3>
<p class="content__text"> There’re a lot of ads featuring penis enlargement gels and creams on the Internet.
							One day, I bought a cream like that in a sex shop. But it turned out to be a scam. <b> Then the guys on
								the forum advised me to try a new solution - <a href="#roulettes"> LongJack</a>. Even those who were
								disappointed in the creams praised this gel. At first, I doubted (they praised extenders, too!), but I
								decided to give it a try.</b></p>

<p class="content__text"> The idea is simple: you have to apply this gel to a semi-erect penis in the
							morning and in the evening. It’d be perfect to combine it with a massage, but I’m lazy so I didn’t do the
							massage half the time. The instruction for use says that the gel consists of the herbal extracts which
							fill your penis with blood and increase testosterone levels, thanks to this, your penis grows bigger.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"><b> The manufacturer told the truth! My penis grew 1 cm bigger within a week. Some
							people might say that’s not too much, but I was truly inspired! Finally, there’s an ad which tells the
							truth!</b></p>
<p class="content__text"><b> It took me 1 month and 1 tube of LongJack to achieve the desired size. By
							the time I completed the course my penis reached 15 cm. I finally felt like a real man!</b>
</p>
<img class="content__photo" src="assets/content_photo_10.jpg" tppabs="https://brumolat.com/content/rfNhRofg9Yi2MKv/img/content_photo_10.jpg"/>
<p class="content__text"><b> That’s when I met an amazing girl – she was very charming and beautiful, she
							was in great shape. I wanted her so badly, but I held off on having sex as long as it was possible.
							<a href="#roulettes"> LongJack</a>
							made my penis bigger, but my complexes were still there.</b></p>
<p class="content__text"> One day, me and my lady got quite drunk and had a frank talk. She confessed she
							loved big penises and told me how big was her ex’s tool.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"> Luckily, I was drunk and didn’t think about my complexes. Rather, I acted like a
							man, I told her she would like doing it with me.
						</p>
<p class="content__text"><b> She’s amazing in bed! She climaxed again and again, she scratched my back… I
							fucked her as much as 4 times that night.</b></p>
<img class="content__photo" src="assets/content_photo_11.jpg" tppabs="https://brumolat.com/content/rfNhRofg9Yi2MKv/img/content_photo_11.jpg"/>
<p class="content__text"> In the morning, I thought she faked her orgasms. I thought I was hardly like her
							ex. <b> But the first thing I heard when she woke was:</b></p>
<div class="content__citation"><span> Your tool is so cool! It felt so good for the first time in a long
							time!</span></div>
<p class="content__text"> She wasn’t teasing me. We’re still a couple, she has no idea that my “long
							sausage” (that’s how she likes to call my penis) hardly reached 10 cm in length in the past.
						</p>
<h2 class="content__subtitle"> Want to enlarge your penis? You’ll do it!</h2>
<p class="content__text content__text_mod"> I wrote this post for everyone who has the same problems as I
							had. At first, it was posted on the PE men’s forum, but now I share it publicly. <b> Even the most savvy
								PE men don’t know about LongJack, how can one expect regular guys to know about it?</b></p>
