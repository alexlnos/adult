هل حجم القضيب يهم؟ وفقا لكثير من الأطباء واستطلاعات واستقصاءات الرأي العام، فقد تبين أن حجم القضيب يؤثر
على جودة الحياة الجنسية والزواج. أوافق على أن غالبية النساء لا يقبلن ذلك علنًا، لكن الأرقام تتحدث عن
نفسها - تقول 87% من النساء، أن حجم قضيب شريكهن أقل من المعتاد وأنهن غير راضيات عن الحياة الجنسية. "حجم
يهم! إحـدى عميلاتنا قالت أنها كانت تواعد رجلاً وسيمًا يملك كل شيء لجذب الفتيات لكنها أنهـت لعلاقة معه.
أحزروا لماذا؟ فقط بسبب حجم القضيب القصير ومدة الجنس القصيرة".
